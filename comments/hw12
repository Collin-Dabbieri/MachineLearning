- There are a few problems here.  The first is that the neural net in part B is not constructed correctly because by design they either output (1, 0) or (0, 1).  The sum of the average outputs will always be equal to 1.  Looks like you were trying to do some things we didn't explicitly ask for.  The toy model should just take a spin state and return a 2-tuple by matrix multiplication (with the non-linearities added at each step).  Also your energy function is over-engineered, but I didn't count off for this.
