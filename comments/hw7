- 1.A: A little overkill.  All I wanted to see was you transform the data, which it looks like you did, lol.
- 1.C: This looks right, but save yourself some serious pain by putting this code in a loop then break when convergence is reached.  I'm concerned that you resorted to doing it this way.  I do see that you put it in a loop later, but I would start with that next time.  I will knock off a point for not having a proper convergence check.
- 2.A: Thats a lot of bins in your 2d histogram to the extend that it's basically a scatter plot again.
