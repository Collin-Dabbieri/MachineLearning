# Machine Learning

This repository contains completed homeworks from the ASTR 5900 Machine Learning course taught in the fall of 2017. Dr. Karen Leighly taught the course and Alex Kerr was the grader. Course materials can be found at https://github.com/OUML/astr-5900-f17. Comments come from the grader and the notebooks were completed by me.
